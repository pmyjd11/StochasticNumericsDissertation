# StochasticNumericsDissertation
The MATLAB code for fourth-year dissertation project on numerical methods for stochastic differential equations.
These codes were used to produce the graphs and tables in the dissertation report. 
This file contains a description of which codes are relevant to which chapter, and also informs the reader how to use them. 
Open the files for a description of what they do and how they work.

Chapter 3 (Brownian Motion - Simulation in 1D): 
The script BrownianSimulation.m is used to produce figure 4 (page 41). 
This code is self-contained and does not make calls to any other functions, thus can be ran as is by the reader.

Chapter 5 (Stochastic Numerics: Strong Taylor Approximations - Implementing the Explicit Euler scheme):
The function explicitEulerGBM is called from code sections 1,2 and 3 within GBMDriver.m to produce figure 6/7 (page 72/73).
Use the 'Run Section' feature to run this code.
